    <h2>Recipe 1: Turkish Doner</h2>
<ul>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3> 
    <li>Onion</li>
    <li>Ground beef / lamb (1.5 lb ground meat)</li>
    <li>Greek yogurt</li>
    <li>Spices: Salt, pepper, aleppo pepper and cumin.</li>

</ul>


<ul>
    <h3>Steps to prepare:</h3>
    <li>Grate the onion and place it in an average size bowl. Add in the yogurt, Aleppo pepper, cumin, salt and black pepper. Stir to combine </li>
    <li>Place the ground beef in a large bowl and add in the onion and yogurt mixture. Mix well using your hands (I usually wear a cooking glove) and make sure all is combined well. Alternatively, you can use a food processor for this step. The mixture will be a bit sticky and that's okay.</li>
    <li>Line a baking sheet or a board with plastic wrap and transfer the meat mixture onto the plastic wrap. Shape it into a log, about 2 inches in diameter. It doesn't have to be perfect, but it needs to be intact. Wrap tightly with the plastic wrap and twist the ends. I like to wrap the log in 2 or 3 layers of plastic wrap to make sure it's fully intact</li>
    <li>Place the doner kebab log in the fridge for 1 hour so it becomes more solid. Then move it to the freezer and let it freeze for at least 8 hours or overnight.</li>
    <li>When ready to cook, place a pan over medium high heat and take the doner out of the freezer. Let it sit for a few minutes but no more than 5 minutes or it'll be difficult to slice. Unwrap the log and thinly slice it using a sharp chef's knife.</li>
    <li>Place the sliced doner pieces in the pan in one single layer and sear for 1 to 2 minutes on each side until fully cooked and brown. Transfer to a pate and cook the next batch. If needed, place the log in the freezer to avoid thawing.</li>
